# fwdslsh.dev

fwdslsh builds open-source developer tools for the agentic web. The focus is on helping publishers create content that both humans and AI agents can navigate reliably—without scraping, heuristics, or expensive parsing.

## Tools

**Rabit** — A dotfile convention for machine-readable content manifests. Add a `burrow.json` to describe your content structure. https://github.com/fwdslsh/rabit

**Unify** — A lightweight static site generator with incremental builds and live reload. https://npmjs.com/package/@fwdslsh/unify

## Discovering fwdslsh Tools via burrow.json

Fetch the manifest:

```bash
curl -s https://fwdslsh.dev/.well-known/burrow.json | jq .

List all entries:

```bash
curl -s https://fwdslsh.dev/.well-known/burrow.json | jq -r '.entries[] | "\(.id)\t\(.kind)\t\(.title // .uri)"'
```

Get a specific entry:

```bash
curl -s https://fwdslsh.dev/.well-known/burrow.json | jq '.entries[] | select(.id == "ENTRY_ID")'
```

Fetch entry content:

```bash
URI=$(curl -s https://fwdslsh.dev/.well-known/burrow.json | jq -r '.entries[] | select(.id == "ENTRY_ID") | .uri')
curl -s "https://fwdslsh.dev/$URI"
```

Search entries:

```bash
curl -s https://fwdslsh.dev/.well-known/burrow.json | jq -r '.entries[] | select(.title // "" | ascii_downcase | contains("KEYWORD")) | "\(.id)\t\(.title)"'
