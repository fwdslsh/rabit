## About fwdslsh

fwdslsh creates open-source tools that help developers publish content navigable by both humans and AI agents. The flagship project is **Rabit**, a simple convention that brings back the structured traversal of early internet protocols (like Gopher) for the modern AI-powered web.

The core philosophy: publishers should be able to say "here's my content, here's how it's organized, here's how to traverse it" without relying on scraping, heuristics, or expensive LLM parsing.

## fwdslsh Tools

### Rabit

A dotfile convention for creating machine-readable content manifests. Where Gopher had tunnels, Rabit has burrows—a warren of interconnected content spaces, each with a map at the entrance.

- **burrow.json**: Machine-readable manifest describing content structure
- **burrow.md**: Human-readable companion documentation
- Works across transports: HTTP, Git, local files, any URI scheme
- Zero dependencies—just JSON files in your repo

### Unify

A lightweight, framework-free static site generator.

- Simple: HTML and Apache SSI syntax with modern templating
- Fast: Incremental builds and smart dependency tracking
- Portable: Runs on Bun, Node.js, and Deno
- Install: `npm install -g @fwdslsh/unify`

## Discovery

The fwdslsh tool ecosystem is discoverable via burrow.json manifests:

```
https://fwdslsh.dev/.well-known/burrow.json
```

## Using curl and jq

### Fetch the burrow manifest

```bash
curl -s https://fwdslsh.dev/.well-known/burrow.json | jq .
```

### List all entries

```bash
curl -s https://fwdslsh.dev/.well-known/burrow.json | jq -r '.entries[] | "\(.id)\t\(.kind)\t\(.title // .uri)"'
```

### Get a specific entry

```bash
curl -s https://fwdslsh.dev/.well-known/burrow.json | jq '.entries[] | select(.id == "ENTRY_ID")'
```

### Fetch entry content

```bash
# Get the entry URI
URI=$(curl -s https://fwdslsh.dev/.well-known/burrow.json | jq -r '.entries[] | select(.id == "ENTRY_ID") | .uri')

# Fetch the content
curl -s "https://fwdslsh.dev/$URI"
```

### Search entries

```bash
curl -s https://fwdslsh.dev/.well-known/burrow.json | jq -r '.entries[] | select(.title // "" | ascii_downcase | contains("KEYWORD")) | "\(.id)\t\(.title)"'
```

### Filter by kind

Entry types: `file`, `dir`, `burrow`, `map`, `link`

```bash
curl -s https://fwdslsh.dev/.well-known/burrow.json | jq -r '.entries[] | select(.kind == "file") | .id'
```

### Get burrow metadata

```bash
curl -s https://fwdslsh.dev/.well-known/burrow.json | jq '{title, description, updated}'
```

### Count entries

```bash
curl -s https://fwdslsh.dev/.well-known/burrow.json | jq '.entries | length'
```

## Burrow Schema

A burrow.json manifest contains:

- **specVersion**: Schema version (e.g., "fwdslsh.dev/rabit/schemas/0.4.0/burrow")
- **kind**: Always "burrow"
- **title**: Human-readable name
- **description**: Brief description
- **updated**: RFC 3339 timestamp
- **entries**: Array of entry objects
- **repo**: Repository links (readme, license, contributing)
- **agents**: Context and hints for LLM agents

Each entry has:

- **id**: Unique identifier (required)
- **kind**: Entry type (required) — file, dir, burrow, map, link
- **uri**: Location relative to burrow base (required)
- **title**: Human-readable name
- **summary**: Brief description for agents
- **mediaType**: MIME type (e.g., "text/markdown")
- **tags**: Categorization array
- **priority**: Higher values indicate importance

## Traversing Nested Burrows

Burrows can contain nested burrows (kind: "burrow"):

```bash
# Get nested burrow URIs
NESTED=$(curl -s https://fwdslsh.dev/.well-known/burrow.json | jq -r '.entries[] | select(.kind == "burrow") | .uri' | head -1)

# Fetch the nested burrow manifest
curl -s "https://fwdslsh.dev/${NESTED}.burrow.json" | jq .
```

## Warren Discovery

A warren is a registry of multiple burrows:

```bash
curl -s https://fwdslsh.dev/.well-known/warren.json | jq .
```

List all burrows in a warren:

```bash
curl -s https://fwdslsh.dev/.well-known/warren.json | jq -r '.burrows[] | "\(.id)\t\(.title)\t\(.uri)"'
```
