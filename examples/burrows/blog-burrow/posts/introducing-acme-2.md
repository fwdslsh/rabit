# Introducing Acme 2.0

*Published: January 5, 2025 | Author: Alex Rivera, Product Lead*

We're thrilled to announce Acme 2.0, the biggest update to our platform since launch.

## What's New

### Redesigned Dashboard

The new dashboard puts your most important metrics front and center. We've reduced clicks-to-insight by 60%.

### Real-time Collaboration

Multiple team members can now work on the same project simultaneously. Changes sync instantly across all connected clients.

### Enhanced API

- GraphQL support alongside REST
- Webhook 2.0 with retry logic and signing
- Batch operations for bulk updates

### Performance

Everything is faster:

- 3x faster page loads
- 5x faster API responses
- 10x faster report generation

## Migration Guide

Acme 2.0 is backward compatible. Your existing integrations will continue to work. However, we recommend:

1. Update your API client to v2
2. Review the new rate limits
3. Test webhook signatures

See the [migration guide](https://docs.acme.example.com/migration) for details.

## Pricing

Acme 2.0 is available at no additional cost to existing customers. New pricing tiers are available for teams needing advanced features.

## Thank You

This release represents 18 months of work from our team. Thank you to everyone who provided feedback during the beta.

We can't wait to see what you build!
